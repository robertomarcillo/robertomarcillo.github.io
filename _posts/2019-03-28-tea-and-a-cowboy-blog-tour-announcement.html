<p>Title: Tea and a Cowboy</p>
<p>Author: Alys Murray</p>
<p>Release Date: May 6, 2019</p>
<p>Publisher: The Wild Rose Press</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Cliff Masters could not be more different from his best friend's younger sister Bridgette Shaw. While he's out roping cattle at his family's ranch, she is running a <span class="il">tea</span> parlor in the town square. He loves jeans and dirt; she loves hostess aprons and proper etiquette.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>But when Cliff's latest flame breaks up with him because of his rough attitude and lack of sophistication, he enlists Bridgette to help in hopes her lessons in refinement will win his girlfriend back. However, the more time he spends with the curvy brunette, the less he's thinking about his ex and the more he's imagining Bridgette in his future.</em></p>
